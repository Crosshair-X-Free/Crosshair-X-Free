## 🧾 About Crosshair X

Crosshair X is a lightweight desktop overlay utility that lets gamers add custom crosshairs to the center of their screen. Perfect for games that don't allow crosshair customization, or for players who want consistent aim regardless of weapon or game mode.

It features a wide range of customization options — including size, color, opacity, and shape. The overlay runs independently and is undetectable by anti-cheat software, making it safe to use in casual and competitive play.
